# Keylogger
This Project is done during my Internship and was built by some reference codes which was given from the company itself. 

This project was created using node js.

index.js - The main file which will do the keylogging function.
keycodes.js - This contains the key codes for the every keys that you will press.
test.js - This will create the output file as .txt and show the result of keylogging

Demonstration:
- For this you need to Install Node js
- After that, run your node js in terminal
- run "npm install iohook"
- After installing create a directory and have this given all files under the same directory
- After creating all files, run "node test.js"
- It will start keylogging your device and store the captures as "Keylog.txt" in same directory
